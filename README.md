### Why is this helpful ?

After you graduate and get a job at a software company, the first thing that you'll encounter is the version control system. Git is the most commonly used as a version control system. But there are other alternatives such as Mercurial, SVN and Helix core. 

Git is essentially collection of checkpoints. If you make some mistakes, you can always go back to the previous checkpoint.
GitHub is where you can store and share your collection of checkpoints.
